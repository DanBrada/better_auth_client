[Better Auth Client](https://pub.dev/packages/better_auth_client) is a client package for [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com). It allows you to use Better Auth in your Dart applications.

<Callout type="warn">

This is a pure dart package and does not take care of any flutter related configuration(s). You will have to manually add the required dependencies and configuration(s) in your flutter project

</Callout>


## Setup

<Steps>

<Step>

Install the package

```bash
dart pub add better_auth_client
```

</Step>

<Step>

Creating a token store

Since this package is pure dart, it does not bother with any token storage method. You have to implement your own token storage by extending `TokenStore` class.

The below example shows how to implement an in-memory token store. You are free to use any storage method you want.

```dart
class InMemoryTokenStore extends TokenStore {
  String? _token;

  @override
  Future<String> getToken() {
    return Future.value(_token ?? "");
  }

  @override
  Future<void> saveToken(String? token) {
    _token = token;
    return Future.value();
  }
}

```

</Step>

<Step>

Creating a client

Now we need to create a client instance that we will use to make requests to the Better Auth server.

```dart
final client = BetterAuthClient(
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth",
    tokenStore: InMemoryTokenStore(),
);
```

</Step>
</Steps>


### Next steps

The package's api is very similar to that of official better auth client, with some differences.

Please refer to the sidebar for available methods.
