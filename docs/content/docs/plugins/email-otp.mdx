## Available Methods

### Send Verification OTP
Sends a one-time password to the user's email address for verification.

```dart
final response = await client.emailOtp.sendVerificationOTP(
  email: 'user@example.com',
  type: 'sign-in', // Can be 'sign-in', 'email-verification', or 'forget-password'
);
```

### Verify Email
Verifies the email address using the OTP sent to the user's email.

```dart
final response = await client.emailOtp.verifyEmail(
  email: 'user@example.com',
  otp: '123456',
);
```

### Password Reset

#### Forget Password
Initiates the password reset process by sending an OTP to the user's email.

```dart
final response = await client.emailOtp.forgetPassword(
  email: 'user@example.com',
);
```

#### Reset Password
Resets the user's password using the OTP sent to their email.

```dart
final response = await client.emailOtp.resetPassword(
  email: 'user@example.com',
  otp: '123456',
  password: 'new-password',
);
```

## Error Handling

All methods in the Email OTP plugin throw exceptions when operations fail. The error messages are automatically extracted from the server response and thrown as exceptions. You should wrap all email OTP plugin calls in try-catch blocks:

```dart
try {
  final response = await client.emailOtp.sendVerificationOTP(
    email: 'user@example.com',
    type: 'sign-in',
  );
  // Handle success
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error
  print('Error: $e');
}
