description: Implement phone number verification and password reset functionality using SMS-based one-time passwords.
---

## Available Methods

### Send OTP
Sends a one-time password to the user's phone number.

```dart
await client.phoneNumber.sendOTP(
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
);
```

### Verify Phone Number
Verifies the phone number using the OTP sent to the user's phone.

```dart
final response = await client.phoneNumber.verifyPhoneNumber(
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
  code: '123456',
  disableSession: false, // optional
  updatePhoneNumber: true, // optional
);
```

### Password Reset

#### Forgot Password
Initiates the password reset process by sending an OTP to the user's phone number.

```dart
final response = await client.phoneNumber.forgotPassword(
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
);
```

#### Reset Password
Resets the user's password using the OTP sent to their phone number.

```dart
final response = await client.phoneNumber.resetPassword(
  phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
  otp: '123456',
  newPassword: 'new-password',
);
```

## Error Handling

All methods in the Phone Number plugin throw exceptions when operations fail. The error messages are automatically extracted from the server response and thrown as exceptions. You should wrap all phone number plugin calls in try-catch blocks:

```dart
try {
  await client.phoneNumber.sendOTP(
    phoneNumber: '+1234567890',
  );
  // Handle success
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error
  print('Error: $e');
}
