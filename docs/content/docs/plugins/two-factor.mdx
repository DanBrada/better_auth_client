## Available Methods

### TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)

#### Get TOTP URI
Generates a TOTP URI that can be used with authenticator apps like Google Authenticator.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.getTotpUri(
  password: 'your-password',
);
```

#### Verify TOTP
Verifies a TOTP code entered by the user.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp(
  code: '123456',
  trustDevice: true, // optional, defaults to false
);
```

### OTP (One-Time Password)

#### Send OTP
Sends a one-time password to the user's email or phone.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.sendOtp();
```

#### Verify OTP
Verifies the OTP code entered by the user.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.verifyOtp(
  code: '123456',
  trustDevice: true, // optional, defaults to false
);
```

### Backup Codes

#### Generate Backup Codes
Generates a set of backup codes that can be used to access the account if the primary 2FA method is unavailable.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.generateBackupCodes();
```

#### Verify Backup Code
Verifies a backup code entered by the user.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.verifyBackUpCode(
  code: 'backup-code',
  trustDevice: true, // optional, defaults to false
  disableSession: false, // optional, defaults to false
);
```

### Enable/Disable 2FA

#### Enable Two Factor
Enables two-factor authentication for the user's account.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.enableTwoFactor(
  password: 'your-password',
  issuer: 'Your App Name', // optional
);
```

#### Disable Two Factor
Disables two-factor authentication for the user's account.

```dart
final response = await client.twoFactor.disableTwoFactor(
  password: 'your-password',
);
```

## Error Handling

All methods in the Two Factor plugin throw exceptions when operations fail. The error messages are automatically extracted from the server response and thrown as exceptions. You should wrap all two factor plugin calls in try-catch blocks:

```dart
try {
  final response = await client.twoFactor.verifyTotp(
    code: '123456',
  );
  // Handle success
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error
  print('Error: $e');
}
```
