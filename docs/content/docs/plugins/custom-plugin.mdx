## Usage

### Create a custom plugin

To create a custom plugin, you need to extend the `BasePlugin` class.


```dart
class CatPlugin extends BasePlugin{
    CatPlugin();

    Future<dynamic> sendCat() async {
        final res = await super.dio.post("/cat");
        return res.data;
    }
}
```


### Register the plugin

You need to register the plugin by calling `client.registerCustomPlugin`.

```dart
client.registerCustomPlugin(CatPlugin());
```

This calls the `initialize` method of the plugin(implemented by the `BasePlugin` class).

### Using the plugin

```dart
final catPlugin = client.getCustomPlugin<CatPlugin>();
await catPlugin.sendCat();
```


## Super members

Each plugin has access to 4 super members:

| Parameter | Type |
|-----------|------|
| dio | Dio 
| getOptions | Function | 
| setToken | Function | 
| fromJsonUser | Function |


### `dio`

This points to internal dio instance of the Client. This already has base url configured. Any changes to this will affect all the api requests across the client. 

### `getOptions`

This function is used to get the base options for the request. This returns a `RequestOptions` object which has Authorization header.

It accepts a boolean parameter `isTokenRequired` which is used to determine if the token is required for the request(throws assertion error if token is not present).

### `setToken`

This is used to set the token in the token store passed to the client instance.

### `fromJsonUser`

This is useful when you want to convert the user returned from the API to the user object. This method will, by default, be `User.fromJson` but if a custom `fromJsonUser` is provided to client instance, it will be used instead.

If you still want to use the default `User.fromJson`, you can do it by calling `User.fromJson` in your plugin.
