## Available Methods

### Organization Management

#### Create Organization
Creates a new organization with specified details.

```dart
final response = await client.organization.create(
  name: 'My Organization',
  slug: 'my-org',
  logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png', // optional
  metadata: {'key': 'value'}, // optional
  keepCurrentActiveOrganization: true, // optional
);
```

#### Update Organization
Updates an existing organization's details.

```dart
final response = await client.organization.update(
  data: UpdateOrganizationRequest(
    name: 'Updated Name',
    logo: 'https://example.com/new-logo.png',
  ),
  organizationId: 'org_123',
);
```

#### Delete Organization
Deletes an organization permanently.

```dart
await client.organization.delete(
  organizationId: 'org_123',
);
```

#### Set Active Organization
Sets an organization as the active organization for the current session. You must provide either `organizationId` or `organizationSlug`.

```dart
// Using organizationId
await client.organization.setActive(
  organizationId: 'org_123',
);

// OR using organizationSlug
await client.organization.setActive(
  organizationSlug: 'my-org',
);

// This will throw an assertion error:
// await client.organization.setActive(); // Error: Either organizationId or organizationSlug must be provided
```

**Note:** The method includes an assertion that requires either `organizationId` or `organizationSlug` to be provided. If neither is provided, it will throw an assertion error.

    {'action': 'read', 'resource': 'organization'},
    {'action': 'write', 'resource': 'members'},
  ],
);
```

## Error Handling

All methods in the Organization plugin throw exceptions when operations fail. The error messages are automatically extracted from the server response and thrown as exceptions. You should wrap all organization plugin calls in try-catch blocks:

```dart
try {
  final organization = await client.organization.getFullOrganization(
    organizationId: 'org_123',
  );
  // Handle success
} catch (e) {
  // Handle error
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

## Authentication

All methods require authentication and will automatically include the necessary authentication token in the requests. The token is managed by the base plugin class. Make sure the user is authenticated before calling these methods.
